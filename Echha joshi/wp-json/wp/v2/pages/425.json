I started experiencing leg pain with loss of fat in my thighs and legs. It was so extreme that even in the summer I could not lie down under the fan with my leg uncovered. I had to cover my legs or they would start paining. This went on for 8 years. I started Mrs.Joshi's nutrition therapy on 22nd May and within 10 days but my leg pain reduced by 80%. Now I wear shorts in summers and can feel the cool air on my legs without the heat of the blanket. \r\nThanks, Mrs.J oshi for the extraordinary change in my life.

Heavy bleeding, anxiety, mood swings, weakness were early signs that were dismissed consistently. In 2018, amidst our preparations of moving abroad, I just went for a random check-up to a gynecologist to get my issue of heavy bleeding addressed. It was found that I had multiple fibroids and my hemoglobin was bare minimum. To cut a long story short, the fibroids were uselessly treated for 2.5 yrs in India and abroad, and my condition just got worse. I was given a million pills to pop and I was told to get on with my life. The blow was struck in the first week of October, 2021 when I started losing my hair. My mane was shedding day by day and by the 1st week of November, I could see my scalp beneath a thin layer of few light, thin locks. I could see a balding head and subsequently, a drooping face. I was depressed, traumatized, shattered. My run from pillar to post never seemed to end as I have seen the so-called best of dermatologists, gynecologists, Ayurvedic doctors and tried every possible home\/google remedy to stop my hair from falling. I met with Echha Joshi through my husband and I still remember, it was the evening of Jan 6th, 2021 when I had my first consultation. She prescribed for the tests that were never performed on me in my 2.5 yrs of treatment by \u2018experts\u2019. After studying my test reports, Echha explained to me the root cause of my problem. My body was inflamed and my stress hormones were terribly high. These were completely new terms to me and no doctor, whosoever, bothered to touch upon these aspects. With utmost patience and dedication, Echha explained to me the relevant terms and their implications. Over the next 45 days, She worked closely with me and the results were exceptional. My mood improved and now it's rare that I have mood swings. My periods last for 4 days, as opposed to lasting 6 days earlier and the heavy bleeding and pain also subsided. My skin looks more radiant than before. I feel more energetic and can manage my daily chores in time. I had bloating and gastric issues earlier. I felt heavy on the lower abdomen. This improved significantly too. I lost a significant amount of weight through just eating the right food. The most vital result of this 1.5-month journey is that I have started to get my hair back. I don\u2019t think I can ever elaborate on how immensely happy I feel when I see the new hair on my head! I am all the more excited to continue this journey with Ms Echha Joshi. She is the one to introduce me to the wonders of food and eating habits. Not only has she worked upon my nutrition, but every meeting and phone call with her has enlightened and motivated me towards a healthier self. Thank you, Echha, for making me feel good about myself. I couldn\u2019t have got a better mentor than you!\t\t\t <\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial-pic\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/echhajoshi.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/testimonial-builder\/assets\/images\/test.png\" alt=\"Shikha Bhatt\">\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial-review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"wpsm_testimonial-title\">Shikha Bhatt<\/h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>37 years old, Homemaker, Dehradun.<\/span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_row\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial wpsm_col-md-12\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testi_content\">\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"wpsm_testi_description\">\r\n\t\t\t\tHello !

After 15-20 days I realised there is hardly any relief and  the problem is much more than what I am thinking.\r\nI was Referred to Eecha Madam through my Brother. She agreed to take my Case and asked to get few tests done & started having daily discussions, engaged me in interactive activities, questionnaires , medical tests to understand and Root Cause the real problem .\r\nMy eating and living lifestyle was just opposite of an Ideal one.\r\nShe made me understand  the functioning  &  importance  of Vital Organs and how one effects the other and the need to have balance of such Vitals. How we can restore and repair our organs by taking proper food, supplements , Yoga all in a Holistic way.\r\nShe made me understand the real meaning of Nutrition & its Importance  in our lives and food items which we should avoid or completely to be taken off from our lives. Initially, I was apprehensive in following it and  avoiding food items I have been eating all my life .\r\nShe made me do Yoga which I didn't like initially and encouraged my family members also to do .\r\nI learnt the basic Yoga like Breathing excercise, Inhaling exhaling techniques, Lungs excercise , stretching excercise,Body balance meditation ,Surya Namaskar to name a few.\r\nAfter adhering with what Madam Taught, Trained and advised me along with 1 hour of Yoga 6 days in a week  .

I could watch losing the golden period of my life to these \"sicknesses\" (along with the pains, aches, sleepless nights et al), and at one point of time,I had little option but to leave my teaching job (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and be a good old housewife.\r\nIn Sep' 22, I was dignosed with a fatty liver. The doctor informed me that this could be onset of liver cirrhosis but is curable through strict dietary restrictions and weight loss ( of at least 5-6 kilos). I also came to know that there is very little that a medicine could do in cases of liver diseases.The gastro specialist emphasised weight loss but could not advise as to how to proceed further in this regard. I was taken aback by this sudden revelation as I was continuing with a regulated lifestyle all these years (complete with dietary restrictions and following them to 80-90%) with complete and non stop medication as per my endocrinologist's advice.\r\nAll this was a blow to my confidence and I was extremely anxious and worried for many days. I kept searching, surfing and talking to friends\/relative (including my doctor sister) for a right solution. I now realise that I was lucky to find Echcha Joshi through a close friend.\r\nI could start noticing changes in my overall health within a few weeks of diet therapy (MNT).\r\nIt was hard to believe that a few changes in my food habits ( no dieting or separate medicine) would benefit me so much. Results of the MNT were visible in the form of remarkably less hair fall, improved skin quality with no dryness, improved bowel movement and bladder holding capacity, no cervicle related pains. The medical reports too were comforting ( HBA1C down to 5.8 from 7.0, Thyroid \/  LFT near normal ). I am now able to do 45 minute walk almost regulary.\r\nThe journey of these four months under her care was a painfree ( and painkiller free) one and is nothing short of miracle for me. She keeps in touch almost everyday  to guide what and when to eat. No words can express my gratitude for her. I have started calling her a super se upar doctor. Her extra ordinary knowledge and guidance has changed my life. I feel more energetic and  confident now, both at physical as well as mental levels. Further, I have found in her a  very beautiful friend for a lifetime to fall back upon for personal issues even. To sum up, both the experience and the person behind are truly amazing.\r\nThanks for everything Echha & May God always be with you.\r\nKeep Guiding people like us who give up so easily\t\t\t <\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial-pic\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/echhajoshi.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/testimonial-builder\/assets\/images\/test.png\" alt=\"Mukta Saxena, English Teacher\">\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial-review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"wpsm_testimonial-title\">Mukta Saxena, English Teacher<\/h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_row\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial wpsm_col-md-12\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testi_content\">\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"wpsm_testi_description\">\r\n\t\t\t\tI want to thank Echha Joshi, for the exceptional and amazing services she provided in facing my nutritional and weight issues.  After following my physician\u2019s recommendations to be evaluated by a clinical nutritionist since my weight, blood pressure, and A1C levels were rising and getting out of control I was given Echha joshi\u2019s information which she was highly recommended.  I must say I was very reluctant in making the appointment, being in the health field I thought I knew everything I needed to know about loosing the weight, I just need to focus, eat lots of salads, limited carbs, little sugars, and lots of exercise! Simple!\r\nI must admit I almost turned around a few times, but amazingly I made it to the appointment. I can say it was and it still is one of the best decisions I had made in my life!Today I can say I am more conscious about what I eat and drink, not depriving myself of the foods I enjoyed eating. I am very happy to report that my blood pressure, and my A1C levels hav decreased to a manageable level, my weight has been decreasing slowly but steadily, having lost approximately 10 kg in a less than a year and a half.\r\nThere have been easy days and a few hard days, but even on a hard day, Intuitive eating is easier than a hard day \u201cdieting\u201d.\r\nWell, leaving the best for last,  let me tell you about Echha, she is an amazing professional, super skilled in her profession, she is very supportive, down to earth, has the patience of an angel, very warm, empathetic,creative, compassionate, inspiring, excellent listening skills, always made sure to have a kind word to say, very accessible either by text, e-mail or phone, Echha , has been amazing to me!\t\t\t <\/p>\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial-pic\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https:\/\/echhajoshi.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/testimonial-builder\/assets\/images\/test.png\" alt=\"Satbir Singh, Advertisement agent\">\r\n\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_testimonial-review\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"wpsm_testimonial-title\">Satbir Singh, Advertisement agent<\/h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"wpsm_row\">\r\n\t\t \r\n <\/div>\r\n            \t\t<\/div>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row class=&#8221;amipara&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; el_class=&#8221;amiimg&#8221;][media animation=&#8221;none&#8221; image=&#8221;648&#8243;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; centered_cont_vertical=&#8221;true&#8221; el_class=&#8221;amiquote&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;162px&#8221;][vc_column_text] The fastest way to get results is to hire an expert to fast track you to success.
