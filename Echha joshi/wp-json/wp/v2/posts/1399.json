For example, unsaturated fats, such as those found in nuts, seeds, and oily fish, can help lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. On the other hand, saturated and trans fats are unhealthy fats that can increase cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsph.harvard.edu\/nutritionsource\/healthy-drinks\/sugary-drinks\/\"><strong>Sugary drinks can harm your heart<\/strong><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>Sugary drinks, such as soda and fruit juice, can contribute to the development of heart disease. They are high in added sugars, which can increase the risk of heart disease by increasing cholesterol levels and causing weight gain.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/diet\/features\/fiber-heart\"><strong>A high-fiber diet can help protect your heart<\/strong><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>A diet that is rich in fiber can help reduce the risk of heart disease. Fiber can help lower cholesterol levels, improve blood sugar control, and reduce inflammation, all of which can help protect your heart.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/33942057\/\"><strong>Processed foods can be harmful to your heart<\/strong><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>Processed foods are often high in unhealthy fats and added sugars, which can increase the risk of heart disease. Additionally, many processed foods contain sodium, which can increase blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/health\/wellness-and-prevention\/take-your-diet-to-the-mediterranean\"><strong>Eating a Mediterranean-style diet can be good for your heart<\/strong><\/a><\/h4>\n<p>A Mediterranean-style diet, which is rich in <a href=\"https:\/\/echhajoshi.com\/10-surprising-health-benefits-of-a-plant-predominant-diet\">fruits, vegetables, whole grains<\/a>, and lean proteins, and low in unhealthy fats, can help reduce the risk of heart disease. This type of diet has been shown to lower cholesterol levels, improve blood pressure, and reduce the risk of heart disease, making it a great choice for those looking to maintain a healthy heart.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In conclusion, the food you eat has a significant impact on your heart health. By making the right food choices and limiting or avoiding foods that are harmful to your heart, you can help reduce your risk of heart disease and improve your overall heart health.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Five Things You Didn&#8217;t Know About the Connection Between Heart Health and the Food You Eat Not all fats are bad for your heart There are different types of fats, and not all of them are harmful to your heart health.
